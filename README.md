# My Happy Glamper: Project One
The goal for this project was to develop an application that would allow a user to find campsites based on an input location, and activities that could occur around there. This project uses the Bulma framework.

The User Story for this project was as follows: 

AS A person who wants to go on vacation
I WANT TO find a campsite
SO THAT I can plan my vacation


The acceptance criteria were as follows: 

GIVEN I am planning a trip
WHEN I open the app
I AM presented with five parks near me

## Satisfying the Acceptance Criteria



## APIs to be used

The National Parks Service API (https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm) was used for information on parks based on state. The MapQuest API (https://developer.mapquest.com/) was used to find things that can be done nearby based on search criteria.
